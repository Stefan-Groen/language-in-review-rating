# language-in-review-rating

**Research question**:     
How does the language used in a 5-star review differ from that in 1-star reviews?    

**Hypothesis**:      
5-star reviews use more positive language, while 1-star reviews use more negative language

**General information**      
In this reserach project the aim is to explore a linguistic pattern within customer reviews, specifically focussing on the differences in language between 5-star and 1-star reviews. By analyzing the textual content of reviews by looking for specific words, I aim to gain insights into satisfaction (positive) and dissatisfcation (negative) among users


**Method**
To do so, 2 variables are defined 
  -	**Independent variable**: review rating
    For this variable I will look at multiple 1-star and 5-star ratings

  -	**Dependent variable**: Language used in the review
    For this variable I will look at the difference in language used in 1-star and 5-star reviews

I will collect a diverse set of 5-star and 1-star reviews from a shopping platform (amazon.com) and perform a comphrehensive anaylysis of the language employed in these reviews. The AFINN Lexicon will be used as a tool to perform the sentiment analysis
